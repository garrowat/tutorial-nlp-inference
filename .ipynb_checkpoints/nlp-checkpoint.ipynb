    "At first, I thought it would be easiest to export and convert my model via ONNX over to Tensorflow, after which I would serve it up using Tensorflow.js. It turned out (at the time, at least) that exporting PyTorch models with ONNX had some [limitations](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html#limitations) which applied to me. Okay, so I'd have to stick with PyTorch. (In the end, I'm glad I did!)\n",

    "### Solution 2:  Use Python to create an API for my model (Winner!)\n",
    "I would just have to find a Python library that I could use to create a simple web API, and then a place to host it. I'd played around a bit with Django, but from what I'd read, it might be a bit heavy for the task at hand. I knew that Flask was a light-weight alternative, and some quick research turned up a trove of tutorials on how to create a REST API using Flask--***Bingo!***"

Basically, any `cuda()` tensors would need to be converted to `cpu()` tensors. This proved to be my biggest headache, one where I had to babystep my way toward the solution."
